libproj is a framework to bootstrap commandline development and get programs
up and running quickly.

Outline of functions:

lpopts - option processing, command interface
init - stores general information about the application that is used throughout the framework

libproj can be installed by navigating to the directory where it has been downloaded:
$ cd path/to/directory/

and then unpacking the tarball:

$ gunzip libproj-0.1.tar.gz; tar -xf libproj-0.1.tar

and finally, these three commands:

$ ./configure; make; sudo make install

There are many options to the configure script, but the default ones should be okay for most distributions.
You can specify a prefix for installation with ./configure --prefix=/path/prefix
