libproj is a framework to bootstrap commandline development and get programs
up and running quickly.

Outline of functions:

lpopts - option processing, command interface

Use is outlined in /main.c. It's pretty simple to use.

The build.sh script helps with compilation.
It is invoked as such: ./build.sh execname sourcename, where execname is the
name of the output file and sourcename is the name of the C source file
